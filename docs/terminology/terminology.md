### Terminology
* **Software supply chain (or SSC)**: the series of actions performed to create
  a software product. These steps usually begin with users committing to a
version control system and end with the software product's installation on a
client's system.
* <a name="layout">**Supply chain layout (or simply layout, or
  layout metadata)**</a>: a signed file that dictates the series of
  steps that need to be carried out in the SCC to create a final
  product. The layout includes ordered steps, requirements for such
  steps, and the list of actors (or functionaries) in charge of carrying
  out every step. The steps within the supply chain are laid out by a
  project owner.
* **Sublayout**: A supply chain layout that describes steps as part of
  another supply chain layout.
* <a name="productOwner">**Project owner**</a>: the authoritative figure
  within a project. The project owner will dictate which steps are to be
  carried out in the supply chain, and who is authorized to carry out
  each step (i.e., define the layout).
* **Functionary**:  an individual or automated script that will perform an
  action within the supply chain. For example, the actor in charge of compiling
a project's source code is a functionary.
* **Supply chain step**: a single action in the software supply chain, which is
  performed by a functionary.
* **Link**: metadata information gathered while performing a supply chain step
  or inspection, signed by the functionary that performed the step or the
client that performed the inspection. This metadata includes information such
as materials, products and byproducts.
* **Materials**: the elements used (e.g., files) to perform a step in the
  supply chain. Files generated by one step (e.g., .o files) can be materials
for a step further down the chain (e.g., linking).
* **Product**: the result of carrying out a step. Products are usually
  persistent (e.g,. files), and are often meant to be used as materials on
subsequent steps. Products are recorded as part of link metadata.
* **Artifact**: a material or a product, as described above.
* **Verification**: the process by which data and metadata included in
  the final product is used to ensure its correctness. Verification is
  performed by the **Argos service** by checking the supply chain layout and
  links for correctness.
