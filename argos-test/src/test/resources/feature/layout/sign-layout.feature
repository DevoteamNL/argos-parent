Feature: sign layout

  Background:
    * url karate.properties['server.integration-test-service.baseurl']
    * def layoutToBeSigned = __arg.json
    * def keyNumber = __arg.keyNumber
    * def defaultTestData = call read('classpath:default-test-data.js')
    * def keyPair = defaultTestData.personalAccounts['default-pa'+keyNumber]

  Scenario: sign the layout should return 200
    Given path '/integration-test/signLayoutMetaBlock'
    And param keyId = keyPair.keyId
    And param password = keyPair.passphrase
    And request layoutToBeSigned
    When method POST
    Then status 200
